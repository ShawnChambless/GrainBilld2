# Grain Billd 2
## The one-stop shop for homebrewers
#### Cleaner, better, more user friendly

## Build Tools
I'm using gulp, with the sass mixins library Bourbon (http://bourbon.io/), the Bouron grid-framework Neat (http://neat.bourbon.io/), and the Bourbon add-on Bitters (http://bitters.bourbon.io/).

## JS Frameworks/Components
Grain Billd 2 is built with the same components as Grain Billd: Angular, Node - with Express, and MongoDB - with Mongoose.
