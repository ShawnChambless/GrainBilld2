# Grain Billd 2
## The one-stop-shop for homebrewers

Grain Billd is built to keep homebrewers form having to visit multiple sites for one beer recipe. I have built an API with the most common ingredients, and made it easy to [research them](http://grainbilld.com/#/IngredientInfo).

## Build Tools
I'm using gulp as my task-runner, with the sass mixins library [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/), the Bourbon grid-framework [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/), and the Bourbon add-on [Bitters](http://bitters.bourbon.io/).

## JS Frameworks/Components
AngularJS, Node.js with Express, and MongoDB with Mongoose.
